            <p>I'm 23 years old and was born and raised in Tucson. I grew up around the midtown area.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I went to college in the midwest to study business, accounting and psychology. I met my fiancée there and we'll be getting married this winter.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I came back to Tucson about 6 months ago and work as an accountant for a local HVAC contractor.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I went into web developement for a number of reasons, but the 2 biggest reasons were because I love using technonlogy to solve relevant problems and I felt like this kind work would always have something new for me to learn.</p>
            <br />
            <p>My outside interests are mainly economics and psychology. I am fascinated with both and would invite anybody who wanted to talk about either to a conversation. I'm always open to learning something new!</p>
